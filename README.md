## About This Project
 * In this project, I've tried to crate a simple e-commerce website with React.
 * You can click on a product to see the product details
 * You can make a search on all products
 * You can see all reviews made for the product as well as you can make a new review 
 * You can add the product to your shopping cart any time
 * You can increment / decrement quantity of a product in your shopping cart
 * You can place order in which a validation is made to fill the form
